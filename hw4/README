Assignment 4 README

The scence is basically just a big green sphere (earth?) with two smaller balls
sort of bouncing on top of it. The main interplay between objects and light that
I am trying to showcase is the shadow that is cast on earth from the light source
which is high above the spheres. I also implemented reflection, although it is not
very realistic looking. I never got around to specular lighting, so that's why 
everything looks kind of dull. I also did not do refraction.

I affirm that I have adhered to the honor code in this assignment.
